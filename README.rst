=====================
lo : Linear Operators
=====================

What is lo ?
==============

This is a package which provide for an improved version of the
LinearOperator class found in scipy.sparse.linalg. It also provides a
set of LinearOperator using scipy linear functions (fft, etc ...) and
iterative optimization methods, particularly geared toward sparse
estimation.

Requirements
=============

List of requirements:

- numpy >= 1.3
- scipy >= 08

Optional requirements:

- PyWavelets
- fht (fast hadamard transform)
